# oak

Oak is a proof checker focused on simplicity, readability, and ease of use.

For downloads and more information, including a tutorial, go to [oakproof.org](https://oakproof.org/).

## Requirements

  * [Ruby programming language](http://ruby-lang.org/) version â‰¥ 2.0
  * [E theorem prover](https://eprover.org/) version 2.3.  E is included in the prepackaged Oak downloads available at [oakproof.org](https://oakproof.org/).  If you prefer to install E yourself, be sure to add E's PROVER directory to your system's PATH variable so that Oak will detect it.

## Editor support

  * The [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/) text editor (formerly Atom) has a package [language-oak](https://web.pulsar-edit.dev/packages/language-oak) which provides syntax highlighting, automatic indentation, and comment toggling for Oak.
  * For syntax highlighting on web pages, there is a [highlight.js language definition](https://github.com/timlabs/highlightjs-oak) for Oak.
  * Similar packages for other editors would be welcome.

## Usage

Oak is a command-line application which takes a proof file as input, and tells you whether or not the proof is correct.  See [oakproof.org](https://oakproof.org) for more information.

```
oak [-v] [-c] [-w] [filename]
  -v  print the version number of Oak
  -c  check for unneeded citations
  -w  wait for validity (does not change proof outcome)
```

## Version history

* improved cross-platform portability

### v0.6 - 2023-07-09
* added support for predicates in quantifiers, like `for all odd n`
