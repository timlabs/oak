konigsberg_edges_for_nodes: for some k, k = konigsberg and
	edges_for_node[k,0] = {1,2,3} and
	edges_for_node[k,1] = {1,4,5} and
	edges_for_node[k,2] = {2,4,5,6,7} and
	edges_for_node[k,3] = {3,6,7}
proof
  there is a k with k = konigsberg

	0n: nodes[k] = {0,1,2,3} by konigsberg_def,nodes_def
	0e: edges[k] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} by konigsberg_def,edges_def

		by konigsberg_def,0e,7_set,nodes_for_edge_def,list_literal

	edges_for_node[k,0] = {1,2,3}
	proof
		x: 0 is in nodes[k] by 0n,4_set
		take any e
			e is in edges_for_node[k,0] iff e is in {1,2,3}
				by edges_for_node,x,2_set,0e,7_set,ne,distinct_nats

	edges_for_node[k,1] = {1,4,5}
	proof
		x: 1 is in nodes[k] by 0n,4_set
		take any e
			e is in edges_for_node[k,1] iff e is in {1,4,5}
				by edges_for_node,x,2_set,0e,7_set,ne,distinct_nats

	edges_for_node[k,2] = {2,4,5,6,7}
	proof
		x: 2 is in nodes[k] by 0n,4_set
		take any e
			e is in edges_for_node[k,2] iff e is in {2,4,5,6,7}
				by edges_for_node,x,2_set,0e,7_set,ne,distinct_nats

	edges_for_node[k,3] = {3,6,7}
	proof
		x: 3 is in nodes[k] by 0n,4_set
		take any e
			e is in edges_for_node[k,3] iff e is in {3,6,7}
				by edges_for_node,x,2_set,0e,7_set,ne,distinct_nats

konigsberg_odd: |nodes_of_odd_degree[konigsberg]| = 4
proof
  there is a k with k = konigsberg
	0n: nodes[k] = {0,1,2,3} by konigsberg_def,nodes_def
  |edges_for_node[k,0]| = 3 and |edges_for_node[k,1]| = 3 and
	|edges_for_node[k,2]| = 5 and |edges_for_node[k,3]| = 3
		by card_3,card_5,distinct_nats,konigsberg_edges_for_nodes
  so for all v in nodes[k], degree[k,v] is odd
		by 3_odd,5_odd,degree_def,4_set,0n
  |nodes[k]| = 4 by distinct_nats,card_4,0n
  so thesis by odd_nodes_def,set_equality
