proof
  there is a k with k = konigsberg

	edges_for_node[k,0] = {1,2,3}
	proof
		x: 0 is in nodes[k] by 0n,4_set

konigsberg_odd: |nodes_of_odd_degree[konigsberg]| = 4
proof
  there is a k with k = konigsberg
	0n: nodes[k] = {0,1,2,3} by konigsberg_def,nodes_def
  |edges_for_node[k,0]| = 3 and |edges_for_node[k,1]| = 3 and
	|edges_for_node[k,2]| = 5 and |edges_for_node[k,3]| = 3
		by card_3,card_5,distinct_nats,konigsberg_edges_for_nodes
  so for all v in nodes[k], degree[k,v] is odd
		by 3_odd,5_odd,degree_def,4_set,0n
  |nodes[k]| = 4 by distinct_nats,card_4,0n
